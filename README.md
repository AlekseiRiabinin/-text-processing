# NLP: Toxic Comment Classification

## 1. Description
Platforms that aggregate user content are the foundation of knowledge sharing on the Internet such as blogs, forums and discussion boards. But the catch is that not all people on the Internet are interested in participating nicely, and some see it as an avenue to vent their rage, insecurity, and prejudices. Web apps run on user generated content, and are dependent on user discussion to curate and approve content. The problem with this is that people will frequently write things they should not, and to maintain a positive community this toxic content and the users posting it need to be removed quickly.
